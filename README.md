<b>koe-koe.com downloader<br/>
koe-koe.com ダウンロード</b><br/></br>
----
Download audios from koe-koe.com using python. The downloaded mp3s will be saved withe the following name {authorName} {title} {idOfTheAudio}.mp3<br>
All the extra info such as {author}{title}{lenghtAndDate}{currentDate}{descriptionOfTheAudio} is saved to a csv file<br>
Newest version saves the files only if they have not been downloaded already<br>
<b>YOU MUST USE THE AUTOPLAY LINK OTHERWISE IT WON'T WORK</b></br>
Everything below is old info i'll  prolly delete it later
<br><br><br>






<b>The newer version saves them as {author} {title} {idOfTheAudio}, and saves the descriptions of the audios n shit in csv!!!!</b></br>
Below this line is for the first release (just a basic downloader!)<br/>

<b>Open the program and paste the autoplay link. </b><br/>
<b>You can get to the オートプレイページへ by clicking on their profile, seeing all their audios, and pressing オートプレイページへ</b>
<br/>An example one is already in the program.
<br/>
<br/>
i'm aware that it's a little slow but hey, i'll figure out how to multithread it sometime</br>
downloads won't be in order, and the mp3s will be named with their respecive ids, for example "300000.mp3"<br/>
